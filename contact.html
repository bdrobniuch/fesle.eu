            <h1>About WHY-HOW-WHAT</h1>

            <p>WHY-HOW-WHAT is a platform uniting practitioners driven by joint mission and the love to share their experience.</p>
            <p><strong>Mission statement:</strong></p>
            <blockquote>
            <p><em>Our mission is to help you and your organization to bring business and tech people closer together!</em></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>We do this by providing custom fit practical trainings for you and the people in your company. We also run individual coaching sessions, mentoring sessions and consultations.</p>  
            
            <p>Our name originates from famous <a href="https://youtu.be/_-fdJzvpX60" target="_blank">Simon Sinek's TED talk "Start with why"</a>. That way we want to show that our focus isn't on trendy and catchy frameworks and practices. We focus on your actual challanges, the things you want to achieve and problems you want to solve. This is how we design our learning experiance for you and your company. We always start with WHY!</p>
