              Going through some job offers for Scrum Masters, I couldn’t but
              notice that in most of them conflict resolution skills were

          <ul>
            <li>
              [1min] Present the participants with this provocative statement:
            </li>
          </ul>
          <blockquote>
            Agile: Bring the Business and Tech "together" by creating a Product
            function to sit between them
          </blockquote>
          <ul>
            <li>
              [2min] Ask the participants on how it resonates with common sense
              and their understanding of that role.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <div
            class="

          </div>
          <ul>
            <li>
              [10min] Divide participants into groups of 3-4 people and invite
              them to generate a list of behaviors and situations from a day of:
              1) a Bad Product Owner which is a Proxy between Business and Tech
              2) a Great Product Owner who brings the tech people to the
              business people.
            </li>
            <li>
              [5min] Each group present their BAD/GREAT PO behaviors lists.
            </li>
            <li>
              [10min] A big group discussion on what was surprising and how it
              looks in their company.
            </li>
            <li>
              [10min] alternatively to the discussion you can hand out real life
              case-studies and ask the participants to relate the examples to
              the BAD/GREAT PO behavior lists.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Summary:</h3>
          <p>
            This exercise is great because it works for a mixed group made of
            both senior Product Owners, Agile Specialists and people not
            familiar with the topic at all. Let me know in the comments bellow
            how it worked out for you.

          <h3>Why Red?</h3>
          <p>
            Red color is one of the four colors from the Insights Discovery
            methodology (a psychometric tool based on the psychology of Carl
            Jung). This tool helps people understand their style, their
            strengths and the value they bring to the team. It breaks down too
            four kinds of&nbsp;
            <u> behavior&nbsp; </u>
            types:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong> Red </strong>
              : who is dominant and commanding,
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Yellow </strong>
              : who is social and optimistic,
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Green </strong>
              : who is laid back and friendly,
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Blue </strong>
              : who is analytical and precise.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            It is greatly described in the bestseller book&nbsp;

            [1] by Thomas Erikson. Now, from my personal experience our super
            brilliant jerks fall into the red type. Knowing that is really
            helpful in spotting behavior patterns and choosing the right tactic.
            Also, knowing your own color can help e.g. when you're green it will
            be much more difficult for you to handle RED JERKs then for any
            other color. So definitely read that book, check out the links and
            take the Insight Discovery test.

          <h3>RED JERK patterns stories:</h3>
          <p>
            Here are some patterns I've notice regarding RED JERKs and how I try
            to handle them (based on my experience and knowledge). I'm not a
            specialist on manipulation and human behavior. What interests me is
            team work and making impact on other people. If you don't agree or
            have some nice tricks or advice, please share them in comments below
            the article helping me to improve!

          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong> Talking in the name of the TEAM:&nbsp; </strong>
              e.g.&nbsp;
              <em>
                "if you do this the team will feel bad", "we all think that
                we're wasting time"
              </em>
              &nbsp;that's a common manipulation technique. A team is a group of
              people with a common goal it doesn't have feelings, the people
              inside do. Ask who exactly feels bad. If the team is present
              during the conversation, move the focus away from the RED JERK and
              just ask the others by name what do they think. Remember to
              separate the facts from the opinions.&nbsp;
              <em> "What exactly will make you feel bad?" </em>
              . It's necessary because others are probably influenced by the RED
              JERK or even scared to share own different opinion.&nbsp;
              <strong>
                <em> Story: </em>
              </strong>
              <em>
                &nbsp;I witnessed a situation where a new senior member was
                bullied by a RED JERK. I prepared an Ice Breaker retrospective
                so that the new joiner could know the rest of the team better.
                The formula was simple &lt;just tell us something about you&gt;.
                The RED JERK was sabotaging it from the start stating that
                everybody in the team already knows each other well. I moved the
                focus away from him and asked the new senior member:
                &ldquo;Jimmy what do you know about Paul (one of the team
                members)?&rdquo; Jimmy responded: &ldquo;Not so much.&rdquo;
                &ldquo;Paul could you please tell your story in our company,
                your hobby etc.&rdquo; We've gone through all the team members
                and even the RED JERK softened and joined the ice breaker.
              </em>
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Talking in the name of people not in the room: </strong>
              &nbsp;e.g.&nbsp;
              <em>
                "I've worked with many developers and they all claimed that the
                retrospective has no value", "nobody in our product group
                believes we can do this, let's don't waste time on this
                solution"&nbsp;
              </em>
              now a red lamp should light up in your head. Remember the original
              purpose of the meeting/conversation because it's likely that the
              RED JERK's statement is for another meeting e.g. f2f etc., just
              propose to meet another time and talk about it. Park his
              statement. If that's not the case, start from asking who exactly
              &lt;by name&gt; has such opinions. Do not engage in any
              clarification discussion because it was not meant to be clarified
              right from the start.

              &nbsp;transparency, autonomy, self-organization, agile delivery,
              you name it.&nbsp;
              <strong>
                <em> Story </em>
              </strong>
              <em>
                : The RED JERK used to call a team for not reporting to him or
                refusing to ask him to make technical decisions "not
                transparent". Another example was when the RED JERK didn't allow
                to participate in a daily scrum developers from another team
                working on the same product wanting to synchronize. He claimed
                that "the company is depriving his team from autonomy" because
                we won't let his team conduct a daily scrum behind closed door
                "the daily scrum is for the developers though". Another when he
                rebelled the team against the PO because &ldquo;planning for
                more than a sprint is not Agile.&rdquo;&nbsp;
              </em>
              It's good to stop right away and clarify the real meaning of the
              words.

                architects etc.):
              </strong>
              &nbsp;the RED JERK will never complement someone when there are no
              3rd persons presents. Just the opposite: when there are
              HiPPos[High Paid Persons] like management and chief architects in
              the room. The red jerk is praising someone to diminish their
              skills and to show how important he is in front of others. What's
              characteristic, is a serious tone of voice always starting in a
              form of "I" e.g&nbsp;
              <em>
                "I would like to point out that I have noticed an improvement in
                &lt;person, team group&gt;"
              </em>
              &nbsp;praising someone but in the same time remaining on how they
              were bad till recent.&nbsp;
              <strong>
                <em> Story </em>
              </strong>
              <em>
                : On an important meeting with managers the RED JERK took time
                to talk about a "success" his teammate (he was constantly
                undermining) finishing a simple minor task made. What was
                specific is that he chose to praise him for a simple easy task
                everybody knew was trivial.
              </em>
              &nbsp;Now a good thing is to talk about this situation with HiPPos
              after the meeting, focusing on facts and sheering concerns if they
              pop out. Also, make sure that they won't make an opinion about
              someone only basing on the RED JERK "kind" words.

              &nbsp;There is a big value in questioning someone&rsquo;s plans

              . But what when the RED JERK goal is quite different? Notice his
              actions when he immediately changes the subject if he is presented
              with valid counterarguments probably following with another
              attack. As a facilitator try replacing the absolute, judgmental
              terms&nbsp;
              <em> "right/wrong" </em>
              ,&nbsp;
              <em> "good/bad" </em>
              , with the situational&nbsp;
              <em> "helpful/unhelpful" </em>
              . Also try asking questions like&nbsp;
              <em> "How does that help (...) to (...)?" </em>
              . If possible try to park the discussion and suggest to postpone
              the topic for a follow up meeting. If you instead continue the
              discussion, it will most likely lead to exhaustion of the group
              and bad morale. In worst case scenario you land on RED JERK's
              enemy list.

                Spreading bad opinions about others with people not having the
                whole picture, leaving the recipient of the message with a sense
                of expectation and responsibility to handle the situation (even
                when it's not her role):
              </strong>
              &nbsp;Another typical pattern is when the RED JERK spread rumors
              and share their opinions on others not supported by facts but
              personal judgments to people outside, especially to Scrum Masters
              and HiPPos, like managers and chief architects. They do it in a
              way that the recipient of the message feels that she should handle
              the situation and do something about it (even when it's not her
              role). The best what a Scrum Master could do now is
              <u> &nbsp;actively do nothing! </u>
              &nbsp;A conscious withdrawal of own projections and "Help"
              deepening the problem! Just listen out the Jerk. If there are
              others recipients like managers you should coach them to be
              cautious and not to pay attention to opinions without facts.

                Making fun of someone behind his back in front of others:
              </strong>
              &nbsp;A common RED JERK pattern is to make fun of someone behind
              his back in order to undermine that person&rsquo;s authority. In
              this case, I try to remind him that such behavior is
              unprofessional and state that I'm expecting professionalism from
              my co-workers at my workplace (RED JERKs see themselves as
              professionals and will feel ashamed). Talk with his manager to
              work with him 1v1 on that behavior. This is less common in
              companies performing 360 behavioral feedback session or supporting
              giving feedback in other ways (explained later on in the article).

              <strong> Creates Ally Camps vs Enemy Camps:&nbsp; </strong>
              RED JERKs divide people into camps. So when you don't act the way
              RED JERK wants he'll start to spread opinions about you and you
              land in the Enemy Camp. People who easily engage and support
              spreading RED JERK's bad opinions land in the ally camp. It's hard
              to be neutral because the RED Jerk will pick you up interrogating
              what do you think about the topic connected to the enemy camp.
              What are the symptoms of the existing camps to be sensed by the
              Scrum Master? You'll hear a lot of&nbsp;
              <em> "We" </em>
              ,
              <em> "Them"&nbsp; </em>
              in discussions about solutions; management will talk about the bad
              performance of the Enemy Camp (based on opinions not facts); the
              RED JERK will be indulgent on his Ally Camp minions setbacks; some
              Ally Camp members start explaining themselves from opinions stated
              in the presence of RED JERK when he is not around. The RED JERK
              tactics is to demonize the members from the enemy camp. What works
              for me to solve this situation is to engage in co-op the people
              from two camps and facilitate a session so they can get to know
              each others more. Also it's good to name things and separate facts
              from opinions when you hear those stated in the ally camp. Be very
              careful while doing this as you will be pushed very quickly by the
              RED JERK to the enemy camp. When you're not neutral for the people
              from the ally camp it will be much harder to fix this situation.

                Monopolize conversations not letting others to moderate
                meetings:
              </strong>
              &nbsp;The RED JERK is an effective meetings moderator. He is
              always engaged 120%. This is how the management sees him. What
              they don't see is that his goal is not to emerge the best solution
              but to pass his solution. It's also a great opportunity for him to
              show how important he is in front of others. The additional
              downside is that his team will be unable to perform effective
              without the RED JERK. The work will not move when he is on
              vacations. Now what works for me is to engage others in
              facilitating or moderating the meeting (which is not always easy
              since the RED JERK will take it as an attack on his position in
              the group) or use facilitation techniques that engages the whole
              group in the role of the facilitator (silent brainstorming,

                purposely ignored him (showing him that when he won't play by
                his rules, he'll be treated that way).&nbsp;

              </strong>
              <em>
                &nbsp;This behavior is common not only inside the scrum teams. I
                witnessed a management person interrogating Product Managers
                pointing out their lack of knowledge about the product in front
                of others (demonstrating that he has this knowledge himself
              </em>
              )
              <em> .&nbsp; </em>
              Now this is an important topic for a Scrum Master solely
              responsible for transparency. Not only the RED JERK's behavior
              introduces fear and anxiety, but also it demonstrates that this
              behavior is OK (creating followers). This is really destructive
              for the Organizational Innovation Culture where key factors are
              fail friendly environment and attitude that "it's OK not to know
              and just ask"

              <strong> Asking for advice:&nbsp; </strong>
              As stated before RED JERKs see themselves as experts. This is in
              some sort justifiable because REDs are great learners - if they
              don't know something they immediately look it up. They learn
              mostly by themselves not mentored by someone. So what does it mean
              when a RED JERK is asking for advice? Unfortunately, from my
              experience they don't do this to learn something but to
              either&nbsp;smuggle some topic into the discussion or to secure
              they future plans (
              <em> "after all, I've consulted a specialist" </em>
              ). So from the perspective of a scrum master my advice is to pay
              attention not only for what he's asking but why.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>
                Wonder out loud publicly that "someone" screwed (when everybody
                knows who). Saying out laud publicly with Bob in the room that
                he would rather like to work with Alice:
              </strong>
              &nbsp;Now that's probably the most JERKy behavior, because it can
              hurt badly the person concerned. Paradoxically, it's easy to miss
              and to ignore by the Scrum Master (in the rush and by other
              topics). It's important that you as a Scrum Master understand that
              that behavior undermines the core Scrum Values hence it's
              justifiable to schedule a 1v1 with the RED JERK and at the same
              time, reporting to his superior.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Reacting on feedback: </strong>
              &nbsp;RED JERKs rarely receive feedback in any form. It's because
              they introduce anxiety and fear.&nbsp;
              <strong>
                <em> Story1 </em>
              </strong>
              <em>
                : A high management person confessed to me that he deliberately
                avoids the RED JERK despite the fact that the RED JERK is "just"
                a software developer (it shows how scary they can be)
              </em>
              . So because they rarely receive any feedback, they lack the
              ability to accept it and easily get defensive. They don't
              see&nbsp;feedback as an opportunity for growth&nbsp;but a direct
              attack on their position.&nbsp;
              <strong>
                <em> Story2 </em>
              </strong>
              <em>
                : A RED JERK shared with my friend something what happened to be
                unethical and even against the law. My friend drew his attention
                to that and offered help at the same time, thereupon the RED
                JERK stopped to greet him and say hello in corridors, and
                started spreading rumors about my friend in the whole
                company.&nbsp;
              </em>
              OK so what works for me is to share&nbsp;
              <strong> only </strong>
              &nbsp;my emotions/feelings&nbsp;

              Monitor your emotions/feelings (they are great JERK behavior
              detector). Stop and Reflect every time your emotions seems
              exaggerated in relation to current situation. Look not only on
              what is being said but ask yourself why. Take a note of this
              moment and whether it is repeating.

          <h3>Is a Team better of without RED?</h3>
          <p>
            Definitely no! There is a higher probability to get an effective
            team out of a balanced mixed color composition. E.g. I've
            encountered how destructive for a team is a dominance of Blue (which
            is common in IT due to bad recruitment based only on corner cases
            theoretical assessments). Also I've seen the best team leaders to be
            RED. What we should really ask is a team better of without a Jerk. I

          <h2>
            Take your chance to get on with your manager. The first two steps.
          </h2>
          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            <em>
              Can&rsquo;t you get along with your manager? Do you have an
              impression that you are from different planets or you speak a
              language unknown to each other?
            </em>
            Before you write your manager off and get rid of him from your
            circle of trust, it&rsquo;s worth to look back again and think of
            whether you have done everything to enable and help in effective
            cooperation.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <div tabindex="0">
              <div></div>
            </div>
          </figure>
          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            At this point, the question can pop up:
            <em>
              Is it really me, a subordinate, who should care about
              relationships and good cooperation between me and my manager?
              Isn&rsquo;t it my manager&rsquo;s role?
            </em>
          </p>
          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            On the one hand you are right. Your manager should have the best
            knowledge on team building, relationships and his employees&rsquo;
            motivation. But on the other hand, what if he doesn&rsquo;t and
            doesn&rsquo;t support you enough? Who will lose? Your motivation
            will dip and you will do the minimum at work. Your manager does not
            use the full potential of his employees, and in the worst situation
            he will lose good staff. Ultimately, you both lose.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
              <strong>
                Humans are only humans. They make mistakes and are not always
                trained in the roles they play.
              </strong>
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            So before you write off your manager, it is worth rethinking what
            you could do to improve your relationship.
          </p>
          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            Below are two steps that opened my eyes and changed my approach to
            managers. They helped me build better relationships and enhance our
            cooperation.
          </p>
          <h3>#1 Freed from hierarchical thinking</h3>
          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            Once I heard a conversation of a parent with a child on the bus:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
              <em> Child: Mom, what is a manager? </em>
            </p>
            <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
              <em>
                Mom: A manager is a person who keeps an eye on people to oversee
                whether they work quickly.
              </em>
            </p>
            <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
              <em> Child: So this is the person who rules? </em>
            </p>
            <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
              <em> Mom: Yes </em>
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            We&rsquo;ve been growing up in a hierarchical world. Since our
            childhood we were taught to listen to our parents, then teachers and
            lecturers. Similarly, when we start our professional life,
            subconsciously we feel the difference in different levels in the
            organizational structure. According to stereotypes, the manager has
            power, makes decisions and says what to do. You shouldn&rsquo;t
            discuss too much with the manager, just execute what they expect
            from us. Ultimately this is the person who will evaluate our
            performance and decide on our salary.
          </p>
          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            If we stick to those stereotypes it will be even impossible to
            imagine equal cooperation with your manager, based on developing
            solutions together and pursuing a win-win direction.
          </p>
          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            If you put yourself in the position that the manager is always
            right, it will be so. Unfortunately, even when the best manager
            turns up at his team&rsquo;s meeting, that causes an immediate
            change in the team&rsquo;s dynamics. The loose exchange of thoughts
            calm down, employees listen to their manager&rsquo;s opinion and do
            not undermine it (their honest comments will be unearthed over
            coffee after the meeting).
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
              Freedom from the hierarchy in our minds is the foundation to build
              an honest relationship and cooperate in a partnership.
            </p>
          </blockquote>
          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            <strong>
              Let&rsquo;s try to look at the manager-employee relationship from
              a different perspective:
            </strong>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li data-selectable-paragraph="">
              <em>
                If a partnership between manager and employee were possible, how
                would it be?
              </em>
            </li>
            <li data-selectable-paragraph="">
              <em> What can you do to get it? </em>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            <strong> Example </strong>
          </p>
          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            I could complain that I have my one on one meeting with my manager
            only once a quarter. What&rsquo;s worse, this meeting feels more
            like a performance evaluation. There is no space for discussion on
            my future role, how I could grow in this company or how my manager
            would like to support me with my goals. I still have no idea if
            there is a reasonable career path for me.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li data-selectable-paragraph="">
              <em>
                In partnership, how would you want this cooperation to look
                like?
              </em>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            I would like to see my manager interested in what I&rsquo;m doing,
            just like we are genuinely interested in our friends. I would love
            to hear his advice about my growth in the company.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li data-selectable-paragraph="">
              <em> What can you do to get it? </em>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            I can schedule regular one on one meetings to establish a better
            relationship and say what is important to me to be motivated at
            work. Start describing my issues at hand and ask for some advice to
            broaden my perspective. After some meetings I can ask about my
            strengths and then talk about how we can use them in the company to
            grow.

            You don&rsquo;t need permission from your manager to go ahead and
            take care of your needs. You can take over the initiatives, be more
            proactive and take the first step. What&rsquo;s more, like any other
            person, you have the right to give feedback to your manager
            (positive feedback is always welcome!). You can suggest lunch
            together, show what motivates you and what your ambitions are and
            discuss how you can get ahead within your company.
          </p>
          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            Your manager is only human, and like everyone, he is not perfect and
            doesn&rsquo;t know everything. By working together and complementing
            each other, you are able to gain better results where you both will
            be winners.
          </p>
          <h3>#2 Understanding your manager&rsquo;s perspectives</h3>
          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            We want our manager to take our opinion into account, actively
            listen to us and support whatever we do. The perfect manager is the
            one, who quickly understands us and is an advocate of our brilliant
            ideas and propositions. And if he doesn&rsquo;t, we easily judge
            that he doesn&rsquo;t understand, is imcopetent and isn&rsquo;t
            influential enough to change anything.
          </p>
          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            <em>
              How often do you show the empathy on the level you expect from
              your manager? Do you know how his last week was at work? What has
              been his biggest success or how could you help him?
            </em>
          </p>
          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            Judging is simple, but before you do it, spend some time to get to
            know the context and the world he lives in. Understand what problems
            and adversities he faces every day. Start listening to him and
            become honestly interested in his story. Reveal new facts and let
            yourself be truly amazed by him. Understand what causes the
            manager&rsquo;s behavior to help unconditionally later.
          </p>

          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            The manager is lonely in his role. He has to convey the higher
            management decisions that he may not always influence or even agree
            with. Because he cares about his team&rsquo;s motivation he very
            often tries to be a protective shield for them. On the flipside, he
            spends time with team members to listen to their frustrations that
            he sometimes is not able to address (this is double frustration for
            him!). He does his best to find the proper career path to have
            motivated employees and sometimes this requires long negotiation
            with other departments or different stakeholders to make it happen.
            It&rsquo;s not a piece of cake to make everyone happy. And finally
            the manager often has no place where he can pour out his
            dissatisfaction to mentally regenerate and continue to work with
            optimism.

                The power of a Sprint Goal (examples)
              </h2>
              <p>
                In this article I will share four examples of the same Sprint
                Goal but expressed in different ways.
              </p>
              <p>
                Imagine a cross-functional, cross-component Scrum Team
                experienced in the automotive industry who is working on an
                autonomous self-driving car project. Imagine that the team's
                Product Owner is on a business trip and can't joint the Sprint
                Planning with the development team. Now luckily the PO crafted
                an input Sprint Goal for the Dev Team so the developers can be
                aligned on what's most important.
              </p>
              <p>
                First let's stop and ask ourselves what is a Sprint Goal?
                According to the Scrum Guide:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                "The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be
                met through the implementation of Product Backlog. It provides
                guidance to the Development Team on&nbsp;
                <strong> WHY&nbsp; </strong>
                it is building the Increment. It is created during the Sprint
                Planning meeting. The Sprint Goal gives the Development Team
                some&nbsp;
                <strong> flexibility&nbsp; </strong>
                regarding the functionality implemented within the Sprint. The
                selected Product Backlog items deliver one coherent function,
                which can be the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Goal can be any other
                coherence that causes the Development Team to&nbsp;
                <strong> work together </strong>
                &nbsp;rather than on separate initiatives."&nbsp;
                <a
                  href="https://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2017/2017-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf#zoom=100"

              </blockquote>
              <p>
                So when I think about a great Sprint Goal I think about one that
                uncovers hidden assumptions and supports further discussion on
                "what problem are we really trying to solve?". To grasp this it
                should contain:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong> WHY?&nbsp; </strong>
                  ($ Businesses goal: What does our organization get out of the
                  whole thing?)
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong> HOW? &amp; WHO? </strong>
                  &nbsp;(Impact: Who and how will be able to do something
                  differently thanks to our solution?)
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong> WHAT? </strong>
                  &nbsp;(Scope: What can we accomplish during one sprint that
                  can move us towards the desired impact and outcome?)
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h3>The good the bad and the ugly!</h3>
              <p>
                So here are four examples of the same sprint goal but visualized
                and expressed in different ways.
              </p>
              <h4>The BAD:</h4>
              <p>
                A list of tasks to do in Jira as a Sprint Goal! Take a look at
                the Sprint Goal listed below and search for the WHY, HOW, WHO
                &amp; WHAT. If you're lucky you could maybe determine what to do
                but definitely not why. No comments, unfortunately this is most
                common :(
              </p>

              <h4>The INSPIRING:</h4>
              <p>
                The Sprint Goal in a form of Image! Nobody said that a Sprint
                Goal should be in the form of text. Remember the Agile
                Manifesto?&nbsp;
                <em>
                  "We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing
                  it and helping others do it."
                </em>
                <a

                  [7]
                </a>
                &nbsp;experiment be creative! The lack of clarification of what
                exactly is the Sprint Goal in the Scrum Guide does not limit
                you, but is actually releasing. Take a look on the Sprint Goal
                listed below and search for the WHY, HOW, WHO &amp; WHAT.

                ! Why not make the sprint goal two or even three dimensional.
                Start not from the solution but the problem that we are trying
                to solve. Tell the story of the user. This can really free up
                the creativity and result in innovation in your teams. Take a

                &nbsp;(My favorite)! A great way to uncover hidden assumptions
                and the WHY, HOW, WHO &amp; WHAT is an Impact Map! So why not to
                use it to visualize a sprint goal. Additional benefit is that it
                stimulates the team on planning for delivering early value

                <li>Focus on value</li>

                <li>Gives a reason to celebrate</li>
                <li>Flexibility and creativity</li>
                <li>Feeling of purpose and autonomy</li>
                <li>Stimulates discussion on possible solutions</li>
              </ul>
              <h3>Summary:</h3>
              <p>
                As humans by nature, when faced with a problem we immediately
                focus on the solution (especially when we are being paid for
                that). A written down and expressed in an engaging way Sprint
                Goal can not only stimulate the discussion on "what problem are
                we really trying to solve?", but also help recall our reasoning
                from days before we started the implementation. An always
                visible Sprint Goal not only reminds us on why we are doing
                something but challenges decisions made in the past and provokes
                the search for simpler and more impactful solutions on daily
                basis.
              </p>
              <p>
                A great scrum team constantly works on improving scrum
                artifacts. Defining a good sprint goal is a great way to achieve
                that. Also experimenting with different techniques for
                expressing the sprint goal can be helpful in introducing those
                also for other activities like backlog refinements or innovation
                sessions (which is sometimes hard especially for teams that are
                not used to look for different possible options to achieve
                specific outcomes). This could be for example a first step to
                try out a User Story Map as a Sprint Backlog or an Impact Map as
                a Product Backlog.
              </p>
              <p>Experiment, Experiment, Experiment...</p>
              <p>Good luck, have fun :)</p>

            Organizational culture has recently become a very fashionable topic.
            More and more companies define their values and expect that their
            employees will bring them to life by presenting them in day in and
            day out duties. The values are posted on the walls, in email
            footers, hashtags, and the staff can be rewarded for the best value
            representation across the whole company. All of those actions are
            undertaken to emphasize what is most important from a company
            perspective and to promote company&rsquo;s cultural expectations.

          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            <strong>
              What is the correlation between the culture promoted by a company
              and how people behave?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            <strong>
              Is a consistent organizational culture important at all?
            </strong>
          </p>
          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            Over the last few days, I had the chance to observe the
            &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; organizational culture in &hellip; one of
            the Polish, small-town hospitals. My husband had an accident in the
            mountains and was taken to a hospital, I didn&rsquo;t know. He had
            to wait for surgery for some days. Apart from the stress caused by
            his accident and surgery, I didn&rsquo;t anticipate feeling any
            other emotions at the hospital. Unfortunately, from the moment I
            took the first step into this place, I felt extensive uncertainty
            and lack of confidence. There was only one question in my head
            &mdash; &ldquo;what is going on here?&rdquo; All my emotions were
            evoked by the following observables:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li data-selectable-paragraph="">
              Between the hospital buildings there was prominent and clear
              information &ldquo;smoking forbidden within the hospital&rsquo;s
              area&rdquo; and just 3 meters further along there was a huge
              ashtray surrounded by smokers.
            </li>
            <li data-selectable-paragraph="">
              Similar information in the hospital&rsquo;s restroom didn&rsquo;t
              deter people from smoking and people were even smoking in the
              hospital beds.
            </li>
            <li data-selectable-paragraph="">
              While shopping at 22:30 in a grocery store about 300 meters away
              from the hospital, I met a patient with a plaster on his leg. I
              was the only person surprised by this.
            </li>
            <li data-selectable-paragraph="">
              There was information in the hospital ward with a ban on staying
              after 10 PM. Of course, I was visiting my husband at this time and
              no one even suggested that I should leave.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            My impression after the first visit was that I missed something and
            I didn&rsquo;t know what I should know. I had no idea what the rules
            were and how real organizational culture looked like in this place.
          </p>
          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            Let&rsquo;s analyze the situation I observed in this hospital based
            on my favorite model of organizational culture described by
            <strong> Edgar Schein. </strong>
          </p>
          <h3>
            <strong>
              Ideal organization &mdash; Edgar Schein&rsquo;s organizational
              culture model
            </strong>
          </h3>
          <img
            class="sectionimages"
            src="resources/images/blog/culture_img2.jpeg"
          />
          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            Schein assumes that there are three levels of organizational
            culture.
          </p>
          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            The first level called <strong> artifacts </strong> refers to what
            we can observe, to tangible evidence how the culture looks,
            especially in terms of relationship, behaviours and physical aspects
            such as inner amenities, the office design etc.
          </p>
          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            -The second level talks about
            <strong> norms, rules and values </strong> that employees follow.
            Some of them can be visible because the company wants to highlight
            them by displaying them on posters or handing the guide rules to new
            employees. You should be able to understand less visible norms by
            asking &ldquo;why&rdquo; about everything that puzzles you or just
            needs an explanation.
          </p>
          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            The deepest, third level is the
            <strong> tacit and shared assumptions </strong> the company and its
            employees have. This level is completely invisible and is the
            foundation of organizational culture and is based on our inner
            convictions that are taken for granted
          </p>
          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            In an ideal world, in an ideal company, organizational culture is
            consistent at all levels. The company&rsquo;s and our beliefs are
            reflected in company policies and values, which are then followed by
            employees. You should easily be able to observe that people&rsquo;s
            day-to-day behaviours and values promoted by the company are
            consistent. Tacit assumptions cause and drive people&rsquo;s
            behaviour.
          </p>
          <h3>Reality &mdash; organizational culture model in the hospital.</h3>
          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            From the first glance it was clearly visible that noticeable
            behaviours were non-compliance with the rules promoted by the
            hospital (a contradiction between the first and second level).
            Employees and patients did not follow the rules that were posted and
            even generally accepted standards. If employees do not follow the
            company&rsquo;s values and beliefs, it is a sign that they must be
            based on other values and beliefs.
          </p>
          <img
            class="sectionimages"
            src="resources/images/blog/culture_img3.jpeg"
          />
          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            Based on the Edgar Schein organizational culture model, from the
            second level there is a split into norms and values promoted by the
            organization and those guided by the employees. Going a step
            further, you can see that the same situation is tacit and shared
            assumptions. The company and employees are guided by various
            convictions and beliefs on which they build their own values and
            norms. In this situation, we can find two types of cultures expected
            by the company and one that is actually alive among employees.
          </p>
          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            I think most of us have experienced the latter case, working for a
            company that promotes culture and values on posters, but employees
            do not understand and do not identify with them. Sometimes it could
            be perceived even as high-management&rsquo;s propaganda. But on the
            flip side, if you ask the employees about rules, everyone will tell
            you what to do and how to behave in such an environment and
            unfortunately such guidance can be far away from the company&rsquo;s
            expectations.
          </p>
          <h3>
            So, is it worth to invest in creating a consistent organizational
            culture?
          </h3>
          <h4>
            What do we lose if we don&rsquo;t have a coherent organizational
            culture in the company?
          </h4>
          <ul>
            <li data-selectable-paragraph="">
              <strong> Motivation </strong> &mdash; if we do not understand why
              the organization has picked certain values we will lose context
              and will not understand decisions and actions undertaken by higher
              management. In the long run, if decisions are contradictory to our
              values, this will cause a sense that our voice and opinion is
              meaningless and without any impact. Going further this entails a
              drop of motivation and our engagement at work.
            </li>
            <li data-selectable-paragraph="">
              <strong> Time and energy </strong> &mdash; that we need to devote
              to understand how to behave in the company and what caused those
              rules (tacit assumptions). While I have been in the hospital for 3
              hours every day for two weeks I have assumed some hypothesis that
              is underlying the causes of behaviours I have observed. But
              understanding the culture and its foundations would take several
              months.
            </li>
            <li data-selectable-paragraph="">
              <strong> Confidence </strong> &mdash; when you see the
              contradiction between how people behave and how they should behave
              based on company rules or social norms we tend to take a step back
              in order to observe and understand the culture and borders better.
              To see and define which rules are valid to follow. Even if I
              disagree internally with smoking in a hospital bed, I did not
              react, because everyone, and especially the hospital staff
              considered such behaviour to be normal.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>
            What do we gain by having the consistent organizational culture?
          </h4>
          <ul>
            <li data-selectable-paragraph="">
              <strong> Safety </strong> &mdash; in a place where we have clear,
              understandable values or rules and we can easily notice that
              people&rsquo;s actions are driven by them, we will trust and feel
              safe. If I saw such coherence in the hospital, it would be much
              easier for me to believe that the hospital&rsquo;s staff will do
              their best during my husband&rsquo;s surgery.
            </li>
            <li data-selectable-paragraph="">
              <strong> A sense of belonging </strong> &mdash; we identify with
              the organization because our beliefs and values are similar. For
              that to happen we have to understand the employer&rsquo;s
              perspective &mdash; dig deeper and see real, meaningful reasons
              why those values are so crucial. If we were following them what
              benefits we would provide to the company, employees and our
              customers. This is the only way to find a profound meaning and
              roots of the organizational culture to identify with it.
            </li>
            <li data-selectable-paragraph="">
              <strong> Work with a harmony with personal values </strong>
              &mdash; If the company has a consistent culture, we can explain it
              to potential future candidates. We can give them the possibility
              to make a rational decision whether such a culture is in line with
              their personal values and whether they want to work in such a
              company.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p data-selectable-paragraph="">
            Is it really worth to build a coherent organizational culture?
            <strong> Definitely yes </strong> . If the hospital I visited, had
            such coherence, I would feel safe and I would trust nurses and
            doctors that my husband is in good hands. We should aim for this
            feeling for our employees in our organizations because they just
            simply deserve it.

          <h3>Backstory:</h3>
          <p>
            The topic of recruitment of a Scrum Master isn&rsquo;t something
            new. But when we faced the challenge to recruit new scrum masters in
            our company we knew there is space for improvements and that we want
            to create our own process. This conclusion emerged from our previous
            experience in being recruited for a Scrum Master position and from
            the approach on how does HR recruit experienced leaders.
          </p>
          <h4>The main flood in mainstream approach:</h4>
          <p>
            Most companies recruit scrum masters asking theoretical questions
            (like in the Agile Imposters 2.0 38 questions&nbsp;

            ) or by performing hypothetical case studies scenarios during the
            interview meeting and asking the recruited person to imagine a
            situation and then looking for particular candidate behaviors (like
            in Case Studies for Conflict Resolution: A key element in civil
            rights training&nbsp;

          <p>
            Although these methods bring value and can be helpful they introduce
            the following downsides:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The answers on theoretical questions can be memorized and learned
              upfront with no practical experience whatsoever. So we have no
              clue if the candidate will really do the job.
            </li>
            <li>
              The hypothetical case-study scenarios during the interview
              don&rsquo;t guarantee that the candidate will act in the same way
              in real life when faced with real situation involving people she
              will be working with. Additionally, in that approach we assume in
              advance that the best way on how to solve problems from the
              hypothetical scenarios is Our Way -which is simply not true (even
              if our solution worked in a certain situation, "You could not step
              twice into the same river"- Heraclitus).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>What did we do differently:</h3>
          <p>
            We wanted to get true Scrum Masters. We wanted to get experienced
            people proven in field of Scrum and Agile. In order to achieve this
            we decided to create our Scrum Master's recruitment process in line
            with the Competency-based recruitment approach

          </p>
          <p>Why do we call it BDD? :)</p>
          <p>
            What we changed in the process is that we didn't start from building
            question first, but instead we started by defining expected
            behaviors.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to do so we created a competency map

            &nbsp;based on Barry Overeem&rsquo;s &ldquo;The 8 Stances of a Scrum
            Master&rdquo; described at Scrum.org
            <a
              href="https://www.scrum.org/resources/8-stances-scrum-master"

            Facilitator, Coach, Manager, Mentor, Teacher, Impediment Remover,
            and Change Agent.

            We knew what competencies we are looking for but we didn't knew what
            behaviors will define those competencies. We started to ask
            ourselves what behaviors do best define e.g a great facilitator who
            is a neutral person accepted by the group with no decision making,
            equipped with facilitation tools, helping the group identify
            potential solutions and improving the process of decision making,
            increasing the efficiency of meetings and following through with
            action points.
          </p>
          <p>
            Surprisingly this was the hardest part. But when we finally defined
            the expected behaviors it was really easy to form proper questions
            around them. We used the Funnel&nbsp;

          </div>
          <p>
            <strong> Example:&nbsp; </strong>
            Facilitator - one of the expected behaviors: encourages people in
            the group to take an active part
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Give an example of a situation where you encourage people in the
              group to take an active part?
            </li>
            <li>What was the group's challenge?</li>
            <li>
              What approach did you choose? What actions did you undertake?
            </li>
            <li>What was the result?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This way we designed a checklist of questions that helped us
            evaluate our candidates. In addition, we solved another problem.
            Before our checklist, we evaluated every candidate with different
            questions relaying on our intuition. Now, we have one candidate
            profile build around what's most important for us, allowing us to
            continuously improve our process. Furthermore, these questions and
            behaviors have a great use for annual performance reviews.
          </p>
          <h3>Our experience in practice:</h3>
          <p>
            It turned out quite difficult to go through all the questions for
            all the 8 stances in a reasonable time. Luckily, some questions
            verified more then one stance at a time. We ordered the questions to
            maximize the amount of expected behaviors shared in one candidate's
            answer. TIP: prioritize the questions by the potential they share to
            expose the candidate's behaviors most.

            . It's over 10 years of life! The average working time in one
            company is about 4 years, but for the first employer many people
            decide to stay longer. That's why it's important to find the company
            that suits you best from the very beginning. How to accomplish this
            without comparison and reference point? What questions should you
            ask a potential employer during a recruitment interview to get to
            know them better?
          </p>
          <p>
            In this article you will find answers to the following questions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>What distinguishes some organizations from others?</li>
            <li>
              What impact can these differences have on your career and life?
            </li>
            <li>
              How do you know, when recruiting, if an organization is right for
              you?
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            First let's ask a question: How can we group organizations? A
            scientist Frederic Laloux has created a great organization
            classification placing them in successive generations going through
            the history of humankind.

            Let's name the consecutive organization generations: RED:
            anarchistic like the mafia, AMBER: commanding like the army, public
            schools, and the Catholic Church, ORANGE: controlling like
            multinational companies, investment banks; GREEN: caring &amp;
            paternalistic like culture driven organizations; TEAL: cellular
            &amp; releasing like network organizations

            So an orange organization is like a machine with a lot of
            controlling process and process imposed roles. People are seen like
            cogs, specialized to perform a specific task. Everybody must stay
            busy and resource management in excel sheets is a common associate
            when running out projects. The focus is on building the products.
          </p>
          <p>
            Green organization, on the other hand, declares "We are family" and
            emphasize that the key to success are passionate people who are able
            to learn what's needed to deliver value. Teams are main building
            blocks and the principle is to build long-living teams. When
            optimizing green organization are more focused on delivering early
            value (instead of keeping everybody busy). Green organization
            concentrates on developing people, and a great product is only a
            side effect.

            Teal organizations recognize that each of us is unique. And that the
            key is not to learn what is most needed but to discover your own
            talent and path, then follow it. Building blocks are small cellular
            groups discovering new ways of working and re-inviting the
            organization purpose.

          <p>
            Managers in orange organization focus on governing constraints e.g.
            by creating process and telling people what to do. They use a
            combination of reward and punishment to induce a desired behavior
            (carrot and stick approach). The result is an over application of
            control approaches and not the recognition that not all systems are
            ordered. This makes people break rules to do their job well. Another
            common pattern is that in most cases burned out "cogs" (specialists
            that couldn't handle the pressure) are promoted to leaders
            positions, which has a huge negative impact on the company culture

            Leaders in green organization are much more focused on creating a
            safe environment so people inside can demonstrate unsafe behavior.

            . They take on the role of servant leaders who specify enabling
            constraints (e.g. by facilitating groups and coaching people to
            grow). The result is you get coherence with huge variation around
            it. That effectively allows locally valid solutions to emerge. The
            teams creates their own process and adjust it as needed. Decisions
            are pushed to the lowest level. Key leader competencies are soft
            skills.

            structures. Remind people of deeper assumptions by saying "This is

            decisions by their own. They also create context necessary to make
            those decisions. Teal is far away from anarchy and this is reflected
            in a range of practices that these organizations do differently.

            Since orange organizations introduce meritocracy, knowledge is the
            key to promotion. This results in tree things: "I don't want to
            share my knowledge with others", "I don't want to show that I
            doesn't know something", "I'm better off showing others&rsquo;
            incompetence". Unfortunately that attitude results in a culture of
            fear and low transparency

            those questions. Some are even a little controversial and dangerous

            (just as side conversation). Another possibility is to ask friends
            who are currently working for this company or find someone from this

          <h3>Summary:</h3>
          <p>
            It's not that green is better than orange, and teal than green. It's
            about what do you really looking for yourself. I know people that
            feels best in green organization. I know people that feel best in
            orange organization. And I know people that are teal. If you seek
            structure and power go for orange. If you look for consensus and
            friendly work environment go for green. If you want to challenge
            yourself and are ready for a journey to discover yourself go for
            teal.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's not that organizations are pure orange, green, teal. There
            always a mix of subcolors. Organizations can also change their
            colors in time but this is a topic for another article.

            Does a Scrum Master need Conflict Resolution Skills?
          </h2>
          <p>
            Going through some job offers for Scrum Masters, I couldn&rsquo;t
            but notice that in most of them conflict resolution skills were
            expected. So here is the question: does a Scrum Master need conflict
            resolution skills?
          </p>
          <p>
            Before we go any further, please do this short exercise. Let's
            imagine that you are recruiting a Scrum Master and that you want to
            check if she demonstrates conflict resolution skills. Take a sheet
            of paper and for 2 minutes try to define what you would expect as an
            answer from your perfect candidate for the following two questions:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              "Describe a situation where you encountered a conflict situation
              in your Scrum Team as a Scrum Master?"
            </li>
            <li>"What actions did you undertake?"</li>
          </ol>

            />
          </div>
          <p>
            Stop! :) don't scroll any further. Try to answer those questions
          </p>
          <p>
            Back to my question "Does a Scrum Master need Conflict Resolution
            Skills?", Well.... in my opinion probably not the way you described
            it!&nbsp;
            <em> [Let's continue to find out if I'm right] </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            For now, please answer another question: Is a conflict a bad thing?
          </p>
          <p>
            Answer: not at all

            Best solutions and outcomes are a result of cooperation aiming not
            for compromise but for collaboration! And conflicts are a necessary
            mean to get there!
          </p>
          <p>
            The job of a Scrum Master should be to create an environment for the
            teams where they can optimize for collaboration. I like to bring up
            this quote:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            "Safety actually means demonstrating unsafe behavior"- Gunther
            Verheyen
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            The Scrum Master role is to establish a safe environment. What we
            need to understand is that safety doesn&rsquo;t mean peace and
            harmony but actually quite the opposite, namely, an environment
            where people engage more often in conflicts (owning them) leading
            not to compromise but true cooperation. The goal should be to create
            an environment where the team is able to resolve conflicts in
            non-harmful way by themselves.
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            "&nbsp;...Conflict is frequent because candor is safe. And that's
            how good ideas turn into great ideas, because no idea is born fully
            formed. It emerges a little bit as a child is born, kind of messy
            and confused, but full of possibilities..."&nbsp;

            Here is how the Scrum Master should approach conflicts with regards
            to conflict escalation level:

              &nbsp;as a Scrum Master, you should create an environment that
              fosters collaboration even before any conflict occurs. Aim for the

              <strong> Mirror: </strong>
              &nbsp;Many times, the Scrum Master should act as team coach

                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SWte55iDwk"

              , being a "mirror" for the team helping them better see and spot
              their behavior in order to improve and learn faster. Using
              coaching tools like: listening, empowering, articulating what's
              going on, open questions, powerful questions, giving feedback,
              sharing emotions, visualize the room temperature, bringing up
              taboo topics, be an example: demonstrate openness and
              vulnerability and more.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Coach 1v1:&nbsp; </strong>
              You should avoid 1v1 coaching when dealing with conflicts. When it
              pops up while coaching on a different topic, it's OK to engage.
              But you should definitely not schedule 1v1 coaching aimed solely
              to handle conflict. It's the role of the Line Manager! What you
              should do is to coach and teach the Line Manager to acknowledge
              the value of coaching in conflict resolution. It's important to
              change her attitude so she starts to resist the temptation to be a
              mediator or arbiter and move towards coaching and council, since
              the goal is to develop proactive teams willing and able to solve
              their problems themselves!
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Council: </strong>
              &nbsp;Definitely a no! It's OK to share own experience (what
              worked for you), but if you want to be a professional Scrum Master
              don't tell people what to do!
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong> Mediate: </strong>
              &nbsp;Do not mediate! The best thing that a Scrum Master can do is
              actively do nothing! A conscious withdrawal of own projections and
              "Help" deepens the problem! Just listen the person out. Mediation
              is a job for HR, who have prepared procedures and needed
              competence for that occasion. If that's not the case, then I would
              support the Line Manager in the decision to deal with the people
              who are the cause of an unhealthy escalation. It's a hard decision
              but it's a right one in order to prevent toxic workplace. There is
              no place for mediation in a Scrum Team!
            </li>

              <strong> Arbitrate: </strong>

            </li>
            <li>

              When you feel that that's the case, support, couch and provide
              legit data for the Line Manager so she can make the right decision

          <h3>Summary:</h3>
          <p>
            The Scrum Master role is not to resolve conflicts but to create an
            environment where people cooperate and conflicts arise as often as
            possible leading to great ideas. I believe that there is nothing
            that suggests that Scrum Masters should have greater conflict
            resolution competencies than any other member of the Scrum Team.
            What a Scrum Master should really have is great team coaching
            competences to develop a team that handles conflict themselves.

            This 4 guys, while introducing change [my five tips for you]
          </h2>

          <p>
            When trying to run an experiment and improve something in an
            organization I always come across these four different groups of
            people:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em> group #1: "We can't do that in our organization!" </em>
            </li>
            <li>
              <em> group #2: "You will tell us what to do to be Agile!" </em>
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>
                group #3: "We need to figure out how to make it work for us!"
              </em>
            </li>
            <li>
              <em> group #4: "hm../meh" </em>
            </li>
          </ul>

            />
          </div>
          <h3>
            <em> "We can't do that in our organization!" </em>
          </h3>
          <p>
            While trying to change something I was approached by those guys many
            times. When an idea is being introduced, they say&nbsp;
            <em> "We can't do that in our organization" </em>
            &nbsp;followed by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>a huge list of corner cases, and reasons why it will fail</li>
            <li>
              a statement that the organization is in some kind special and just
              not meant to be Agile (but without justification or any valid
              arguments)
            </li>
            <li>
              a panic reaction that it will break the product, the business or
              slow the development considerably (but not willing to find answers
              on how we could make it work)
            </li>
            <li>
              a suggestion that they are already doing this with examples which
              are actually changing the meaning of what we are trying to achieve
              (e.g.&nbsp;
              <a
                href="https://pbernardo.com/2019/04/21/scrum-haters-you-can-read-the-scrum-guide-for-free/"
                target="_blank"

                [6]
              </a>
              ).
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            My advice is not to engage in trying to convince them to run the
            experiment, since their goal isn't to prevent the organization from
            failing, but to maintain the status quo
            <a
              href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/garyvaynerchuk_salespeople-stop-trying-to-convince-activity-6600423383656087552-9yKz"

            >
              [5]
            </a>
            .
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it's a very good idea to listen to them, because some of
            the arguments they state can actually help you justify the
            experiment, since those are usually the symptoms of the problem you
            are trying to solve. Everybody around says that the project is
            doomed, so we need to try out something new, anyway.
          </p>
          <p>
            How to determine that we're dealing with the "status quo" guys and
            not truly concerned employees? You will be able to observe that they
            do not listen to you and just repeat same stuff like a broken
            record. Also they will change the topic when presented with valid
            counterarguments.
          </p>
          <p>
            TIP#1: When they state&nbsp;
            <em> "We can't do that in our organization" </em>
            &nbsp;while you are introducing the experiment, park that statement
            and encourage them to approach you after the meeting to figure out
            how we could address all the potential threats. If they are really
            concerned, they will reach out.&nbsp;

          <h3>
            <em> "You will tell us what to do to be Agile!" </em>
          </h3>
          <p>
            They are either naive that the world around can change without them
            or just stating this for PR reasons so they can claim&nbsp;
            <em> "we're Agile" </em>
            &nbsp;and be a part of a potential success. From my experience, they
            will change their minds at the earliest opportunity.
          </p>
          <p>
            These guys are a great counterweight to the pessimistic&nbsp;
            <em> "We can't do that in our organization!" </em>
            , but if they approach you, be only a mentor and storyteller. Don't
            give in and don't engage to run the experiment at their backyard
            because they aren't committed to the change. Otherwise, your
            experiment will end halfway as a failure.
          </p>
          <p>
            They're typically over optimistic. They don't share potential risks
            that should be addressed before running the experiment. When working
            with them, you will also notice that they don't really team up with
            you. Instead, they treat you as an executor or a knowledge base.
          </p>
          <p>
            TIP#2: Ask them: "Could you please share with me what exactly did
            you do since last month to improve your organization agility or
            remove any wastes?". If they really want to become Agile, they will
            have no problem with that question. Remember that by improve you
            don't mean create more process and roles but: more value, more
            purpose, more understanding, more passion, more reliability, more
            responsiveness

          </h3>
          <p>
            These are those guys you're looking for. Change agents that see
            problems and are looking for solutions. They want to team up and
            follow it through to the end. They engage with you and share
            problems they see, and brainstorm with you on possible solutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you are proposing improvements, they ask the&nbsp;
            <em> "yes, but"&nbsp; </em>
            questions (only one at a time), discussing the topic until they're
            confident that the experiment won't backfire and when they really
            feel that it promises more benefits then potential drawbacks. You
            also have the feeling that they listen to you, and you eventually
            end up as friends :)
          </p>
          <p>
            TIP#3: They are open to learn, so share interesting videos and
            readings with them.
          </p>

          </h3>
          <p>
            This group is rather interested in developing the product and
            focused on everyday work and new technologies. They don't think so
            much about the organization's ways of working and wastes in the
            process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Monitor them since they can be easily pulled on the side of "status
            quo" defenders.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their characteristic is that they are realistic and sometimes
            critical, but they never enter the never ending loop of&nbsp;
            <em> "We can't do that in our organization!" </em>
            , and are always open for small experiments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Decide if it is helpful to convince them to run the experiment or
            just do it anyway, since they probably don't care so much.
          </p>
          <p>
            TIP#4: They are great in giving valuable feedback afterwards which
            is helpful to determine if the experiment was successful.
          </p>
          <h3>Summary:</h3>
          <p>
            A successful Agile transformation needs to be both top-down and
            bottom-up. The best way to succeed is trying to find change agents

            &nbsp;inside the organization and team up with them. Combining their
            long term business domain experience with yours from other companies
            can result in a really convincing strategy that can engage
            management and make them support the change.
          </p>
          <p>
            TIP#5: Don't just focus &ldquo;vertically&rdquo; on people above
            your position but also create &ldquo;horizontal&rdquo; alliances
            with others in the organization.
          </p>

            countries
          </h2>
          <p>
            In this short article I will share my facilitation guide for a
            creative Ice Breaker exercise using Rory's Story Cubes&reg; for
            teams working on the same product but in different locations.
          </p>
          <h3>Backstory:</h3>
          <p>
            The team I've recently joined from Krakow, Poland was visiting our
            headquarters in Austria and meeting other people involved in the
            development of a game we just finished. We had planned a big
            retrospective and meetings related to the next important milestones.
          </p>
          <p>
            What I needed was a way to create a safe and relaxing environment
            for me and other team members, especially new ones, and those not so
            comfortable in speaking English. My goal was to put our fears aside,
            build relationships, focus on our goals and recharge batteries after
            a long car trip. In order to achieve this, I've proposed to start
            with an Ice Breaker exercise.
          </p>
          <p>I was politely warned:</p>
          <blockquote>
            "But please don't force us to touch each other"
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            Hence I knew they probably had previous experience with irrelevant,
            pointless, or poorly designed icebreakers. So in order to make it
            work it had to be fun, creative and non-physical.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've searched&nbsp;trainers Facebook groups and found&nbsp;<a
              href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateusz-kalamarz/"
              target="_blank"
              >Mateusz Kałamarz</a
            >&nbsp;(Design Thinking Facilitator) who shared his experience with
            Rory's Story Cubes&reg;.
          </p>
          <p>
            I only had to redefine the game mechanics to achieve what I've
            intended. Finally I've created a 15 minutes Ice Breaker which served
            its purpose surprisingly well.

            "Rory&rsquo;s Story Cubes&reg;&nbsp;originated as a creative problem
            solving tool for adults, way back in 2004. Rory was a creativity
            trainer and coach, working with individuals and organisations to
            look at problems in different ways. The idea was conceived using an
            invention technique called &lsquo;Advanced Civilisation&rsquo; (by
            Win Wenger)."[1]

          <h4>
            <strong>Instructions part one (</strong>pairing up and
            storytelling<strong>):</strong>
          </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              randomly take one STORY CUBE from the pull of 36 cubes on the
              table
            </li>
            <li>pair up with someone you know least</li>
            <li>roll the Cube dice</li>
            <li>
              your task is to learn a story from the life of your pair/mate
              related to the icon on the cube
            </li>
            <li>you've got 2 minutes each</li>
            <li>
              (if there is still time)* roll with your pair/mate two dices and
              create a story about the product you are developing basing on
              those two story cubes
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>
            Instructions&nbsp;<strong>part two (</strong>sharing stories in a
            big circle<strong>):</strong>
          </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              gather in a circle with the rest of participants (next to your
              pair/mate)
            </li>
            <li>introduce your pair/mate</li>
            <li>tell what picture was on the dice</li>
            <li>tell what story did you learn about your pair/mate</li>
            <li>
              together with your pair/mate tell the short story about the
              product (If you had time to create it)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Facilitation Guidelines:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Take your time to introduce Rory's Story Cubes&reg; (they arouse
              curiosity so the participants don't focus on the instructions).
            </li>
            <li>
              It's common that participants ask the facilitator what particular
              image on the cube means. Tip: Just tell them it's up to them.
            </li>
            <li>
              When working in pairs make sure they understand the task and stay
              focused, remind them about the additional task to "create a story
              about the product you are developing" when they still have some
              time left.
            </li>
            <li>
              When presenting the stories in groups make sure they introduce
              their pair/mate by name, and show the whole group what was their
              picture on the Story Cubes.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Summary:</h3>
          <p>
            The Ice Breaker worked really well and I received positive feedback.
            We had a lot of fun, The Ice was broken and we gained new energy to
            follow up with the big retrospective. I hope it will work similar
            for you.
          </p>
